Simple but powerful boilerplate bode for backend RESTful services - ready for use with Google AppEngine. A module based structure is used to create simple and decoupled code. To add a new endpoint, simply create a new module with a controller and model and add that module to the available routes.

## Example
Take a look at the example module `messages` to get an idea of how to best use this boilerplate. The handler functions in the controller are made available in the `routes.go` file.
